      <p><strong>MISSION STATEMENT</strong>
        <br> Through exploring these texts, we hope to get a better understanding and insight on how Christian missionary work affected the lives of native Africans,
        as well as construct a clear timeline to tell the story of this point in history. Above all, we seek to be a resource for those looking into these topics.
