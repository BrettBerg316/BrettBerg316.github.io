      <h1>Evangelical Colonialism: Missionaries and Their Impacts on African Communities During The 19th Century</h1>
      <p>Welcome to my webpage! This is a timeline dedicated to mapping out and
      analyzing historical documents that relate to Christian missionaries and
    their relationship to colonialism in Africa during the 19th century. All
   documents are sourced from ONE MORE VOICE and surrounding sources.</p>
      <p>The texts listed below are a collection of works from One More Voice that each relate to Christian missionary work in the mid to late 1800s, particularly having to do with Britain’s relationships with the natives peoples of regions in Africa. These texts include the likes of letters to missionary organizations accounts of efforts made by those organizations in the non-British regions, and manuscripts detailing the religious practices of the native people. Each work contains some reference to the themes of the impact of the introduction of Christianity to these peoples (particularly for colonial and assimilation purposes), how missionaries interacted with these peoples, and the repercussions of English church involvement in the given period. What I’m interested in is the various missionary organizations sponsored by the British government (ex. London Missionary Society) and how exactly they interacted with non-British settlements in Africa and other regions. These societies also had many non-white missionaries associated with them, so I’m curious as to their views on their place in the religious colonial effort.
